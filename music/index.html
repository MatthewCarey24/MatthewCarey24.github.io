  <h1>Music</h1>
  <p>I am trained as a classical guitarist, though I went through a huge Billy Joel phase during COVID and learned some piano, and my buddy in highschool let me borrow his little brother's alto saxophone and I taught myself the essential saxophone repetoire: Careless Whisper, Baker Street, and a couple Hall & Oates solos. I also took singing lessons in senior spring. Here I document whatever I happen to be working on.  </p>
